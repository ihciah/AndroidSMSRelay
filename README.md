# AndroidSMSRelay
Script to forward android(with root) sms using adb

- Forward sms to telegram chat.
- Match contacts automaticly.
- Send sms using telegram.
- Some useful features: 
	- Query phone number.
	- Query curriculum.

Prerequisite:

- An android device with root and debug mode open(I use an android 4.0.4).
- A linux server with network and adb tools installed(I use shadowsocks to provide a socks5 proxy for connecting to telegram server because of the GFW).
